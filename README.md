# Hell's Rebels 2e

This is a module for use in conjunction with the Pathfinder 2nd Edition game system for Foundry VTT. Hell's Rebels 2e contains a compendium of actors converted from the Pathfinder 1st Edition Adventure Path "Hell's Rebels" to be compatible with the Pathfinder 2nd Edition game system. Special thanks go out to Tetranaut (of whom 90% of converted stat blocks were provided by), as well as Bruno, Neberu, MediumRare and Cyouni for filling in any missing gaps.

The following should be considered when using this module:

• The compendium is all encompassing, meaning every creature that's in the adventure path is also in the compendium, even if they didn't require a conversion. So creatures such as Tooth Fairy are included for completions sake, even though the same stat block is also available in the system compendiums.

• Actors are named (for the most part) by their stat block name in the books. For example, Mephiry is named "Mephiry" even though he's just the Hell Hound stat block, but it also includes a Hell Hound stat block for later in the adventure when you fight unnamed Hell Hounds. If you're ever struggling to find the stat blocks you're looking for, try searching the creatures unique or reflavoured name from the book, such as the Crocodile stat block being named "Albino Aligator".

• There are many, *many* stat blocks not included here simply because there are currenly no conversions available for them yet, however this is primarily for one of two reasons. Either because the NPC is friendly or at least non-hostile, either way the adventure never intends for the PCs to fight them, so it was not considered important to provide them with a conversion, the other reason is that they are from the random encounter tables, and as many people don't use those tables, their conversion has not been considered high priority, leaving large gaps of converted creatures in the random encounter tables, and I decided that unless all the tables were complete, they weren't worth including. This may change in the future if the stat blocks are fully converted.
